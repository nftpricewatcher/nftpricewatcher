# Opensea Scraper

ðŸŽ‰ **UPDATE 2021-Nov-3**: Opensea officially [updated their API](https://twitter.com/apiopensea/status/1455918328397144069). You can get accurate realtime floor prices from this endpoint: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v1/collection/{slug}/stats`:
```js
const axios = require("axios");

async function getFloorPrice(slug) {
  try {
    const url = `https://api.opensea.io/collection/${slug}/stats`;
    const response = await axios.get(url);
    return response.data.stats.floor_price;
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    return undefined;
  }
}

await getFloorPrice("lostpoets");
await getFloorPrice("treeverse");
await getFloorPrice("cool-cats-nft"); 
```

If you need floor prices, please use the official API (see above ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†). This scraper still can be used to scrape additional information about offers (tokenId, name, tokenContractAddress and offerUrl) as well as the ranking.

## Install

```bash
npm install opensea-scraper
```

## Usage

â„¹ **`slug`** is the human readable identifier that opensea uses to identify a collection. It can be extracted from the URL: https://opensea.io/collection/{slug}
![slug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44790691/131232333-b79c50d7-606c-480a-9816-9d750ab798ff.png)

â„¹ **`options`** is an object with the following keys
- **`debug`** [Boolean] launches chromium locally, omits headless mode (default: `false`)
- **`logs`** [Boolean]: display logs in the console (default: `false`)
- **`sort`** [Boolean]: sorts the offers by lowest to highest (default: `true`)
- **`browserInstance`** [PuppeteerBrowser]: bring your own browser instance for more control

```js
const OpenseaScraper = require("opensea-scraper");

// which nft project to scrape?
const slug = "cool-cats-nft";

// options
const options = {
  debug: false,
  logs: false,
  sort: true,
  browserInstance: undefined,
}

// get basic info (from the opensea API)
const basicInfo = await OpenseaScraper.basicInfo(slug);

// get offers from opensea. Each offer includes the floor price, tokenName,
// tokenId, tokenContractAddress and offerUrl
let result = await OpenseaScraper.offers(slug, options);
console.dir(result, {depth: null}); // result object contains keys `stats` and `offers`

// get offers from opensea using a custom link
// Opensea supports encoding filtering in the URL so this method is helpful for getting
// a specific asset (for example floor price for a LAND token from the sandbox collection)
const url = "https://opensea.io/collection/sandbox?search[sortAscending]=true&search[sortBy]=PRICE&search[stringTraits][0][name]=Type&search[stringTraits][0][values][0]=Land&search[toggles][0]=BUY_NOW";
result = await OpenseaScraper.offersByUrl(url, options);
console.dir(result, {depth: null}); // result object contains keys `stats` and `offers`

// scrape all slugs, names and ranks from the top collections from the rankings page
// sorted by all time volume => https://opensea.io/rankings?sortBy=total_volume
// `nbrOfPages` specifies how many pages should be scraped (1 page = 100 collections)
const nbrOfPages = 2;
const ranking = await OpenseaScraper.rankings(nbrOfPages, options);
```

### Debugging

To investigate an issue turn on logs and debug mode (`debug: true` and `logs: true`):
```js
const result = await OpenseaScraper.offers("treeverse", {
  debug: true,
  logs: true
});
```

### Bring your own puppeteer

if you want to customize the settings for your puppeteer instance you can add your own puppeteer browser instance in the options:
```js
const puppeteer = require("puppeteer");
const myPuppeteerInstance = await puppeteer.launch(myCustomSettings);

const result = await OpenseaScraper.offer("cool-cats-nft", {
  browserInstance: myPuppeteerInstance
});
```

npm run demo
```
